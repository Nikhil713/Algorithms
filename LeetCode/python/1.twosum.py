# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# Example:

# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].


class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if target - nums[i] in nums[i+1:]:
                return(i, nums.index(target - nums[i],i+1))
