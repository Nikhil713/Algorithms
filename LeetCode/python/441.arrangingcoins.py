# You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

# Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

# n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

# Example 1:

# n = 5

# The coins can form the following rows:
# ¤
# ¤ ¤
# ¤ ¤

# Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

# Example 2:

# n = 8

# The coins can form the following rows:
# ¤
# ¤ ¤
# ¤ ¤ ¤
# ¤ ¤

# Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = (-1 + (1+8*n)**(1/2))/2
        return(int(res))
