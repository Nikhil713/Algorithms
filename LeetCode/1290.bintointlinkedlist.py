# https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/

# Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

# Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,0,1]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
# Example 2:

# Input: head = [0]
# Output: 0
# Example 3:

# Input: head = [1]
# Output: 1
# Example 4:

# Input: head = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
# Output: 18880
# Example 5:

# Input: head = [0,0]
# Output: 0
 

# Constraints:

# The Linked List is not empty.
# Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
# Each node's value is either 0 or 1.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:

    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        
        arr = []
        while (head != None):
            arr.append(head.val)
            head = head.next
        n = 0
        size = len(arr)
        for i in range(size):
            n += arr[len(arr) - i - 1] * 2**i
        return n
