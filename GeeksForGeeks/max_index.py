Given an array A[] of N positive integers. The task is to find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of A[i] <= A[j].

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, depicting total number of test cases.  Then T test case follows. First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. Next line contains N space separated integeres denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
Print the maximum difference of the indexes i and j in a separtate line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 107
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1018

Example:
Input:
1
9
34 8 10 3 2 80 30 33 1

Output:
6

Explanation:
Testcase 1:  In the given array A[1] < A[7] satisfying the required condition(A[i] <= A[j]) thus giving the maximum difference of j - i which is 6(7-1).
#code

tcase = int(input())

for i in range(tcase):
    
    size = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
    maxdiff = 0
    
    start = 0
    
    while (start <= size):
        end = size - 1
        
        if(maxdiff > end - start):
            break
        
        while (start <= end):
            
            if (arr[start] <= arr[end]):
                if (end - start > maxdiff):
                    maxdiff = end - start
                break
            
            if (arr[start] > arr[end]):
                end-=1
            
        start+=1
        
    
    print(maxdiff)
